# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Python

These videos have helped me tremendously understand these specific concepts, the instructor (Alvin Zablan) is amazing, and he teaches very well. Dynamic programming was a topic I had a lot of trouble understanding and after watching his video it actually clicked. I truly believe these videos are what helped me recently get a job.

Watch the videos do the practice problems he does while watching and then go to leetcode and solve simillar.
