root,node,leaf,parent,child

Binary tree -  
1. has atmost 2 children
2. has exactly 1 root - root should not have a parent
3. a path between root and node

1 root - binary tree with 1 node
0 root - binary tree with 0 node


Depth first search - Iterative, Recursive 

1. uses stack to store values
2. base case , iteration to add values to stack and call child nodes
3. Draw the recursive tree diagram and completly solve one example and code seeing that example.

breath first Search - Iterative

1. uses queue to store values
2. base case , iteration to add values to queue and call child nodes
